Web Development II Final Web Assignment

Create a README.md file and save it at the root of your site. In the readme file add information assuming that you are asked to explain the following about your portfolio in an interview, "Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?" Finally, include a list of any assets or resources you used that was not your own, including any frameworks, libraries, plugins, fonts, or images. You will need to use the [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to format your README.md file. 

The process began with the prototype, of course. In the prototyping phase, I did try to make the design easy so that I wouldn't have complicated elements to code. The next part was sketching out on my iPad the different sections of each page, and then writing the general skeleton code for that with tons of comments to direct myself with what I needed to do, or where I needed elements to go. Following that, I worked on the Headers and Footers on the Index page, then copied it to the others, just to make the process easier for myself. After that, I branched out into working on the bigger structures like using Bootstrap grid, adding images, making the general form, and basic layout structure. Further, it moved into adding details such as changing colours so that I felt like I was moving forward in the portfolio. Everytime I hit a mental wall, I do something easy, like adding in the ARIA roles, or SCHEMA, or image alts etc. As I get closer to the end its just general tweaks along with a few things I was not able to find solutions for quickly.

The biggest challenges were the carousel, customizing the navbar, and making sure the page is responsive. The carousel was something that stumped me for no reason. I thought maybe Bootstrap would be able to customize it within the HTML with its own classes, but I ended up having to use CSS to customize it more. Coding it how it was in my prototype was definitely not something I would be capable of coding, so I did opt for a basic carousel. Next was customizing the navbar. I kept consulting Boostrap Docs, and tried EVERYTHING! I tried CSS, I tried colour themes with variations in CSS, I tried using Bootstrap colour classes as well and it just wouldn't change colour. I asked my classmates if anyone was able to change it, and luckily Joy and I found the solution. Lastly: making the page responsive. I think one of my Web Dev weaknesses, is that I find it difficult to make the page responsive. I had to research exactly how the breakpoints work within Bootstrap because I suppose I still have difficulty understanding it. 

I learned that sometimes I overcomplicate things, such as with the carousel. I was stressing about it for a long time and the solution was really simple with using CSS. I do break things down into smaller lists so that I don't get overwhelmed, but I think the more I work on it, the more I find that needs to change. But this is something that I think is normal with any work: you stare at it long enough that you begin to hate it.
